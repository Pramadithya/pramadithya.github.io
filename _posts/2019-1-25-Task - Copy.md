So.. I was told to make a CV for my self.. ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/header-post-2.jpg)


I was tasked to make a **web page** and include my **CV** in it by my college lecturer. 
Well.. I've planned to make one since forever, so its a good thing that the time to make it finally come and yea,
I've done it. You can check it [here](https://pramadithya.github.io/pramadithya.github.io/about/).

First things first, I've never developed my skills in web design before, so when the lecturer told me that I've
to include the CV in the web page, I was shocked. But then I study a little bit about HTML and CSS and finally
made this page, but how about the CV? I'm not really there yet, I haven't developed my skill enough to
make a fancy looking CV web page with a lot of gimmick like every one else.. So, yeah. I'll come back when I'm ready...

Yea, that's that I guess.. See ya around.
